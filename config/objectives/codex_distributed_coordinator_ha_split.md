Deliver the next phase of distributed coordinator HA work by completing the highest-priority split task documented in `/Users/sdevisch/dev/orxaq-ops/docs/DISTRIBUTED_COORDINATOR_DMN_DAG_REMAINING_WORK_PLAN.md`.

Work through the new task list in `config/tasks_distributed_coordinator_ha_split.json`, starting with the first incomplete entry, and produce verified changes before marking the task as done.

Focus on small, testable increments and note blockers or dependencies that prevent finishing the task within this run.
