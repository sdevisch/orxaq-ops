# Autonomous Testing Lane Objective

## Primary Goals
- Expand test coverage for autonomous systems
- Improve reliability and robustness of testing infrastructure
- Develop advanced testing methodologies for complex autonomous workflows

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Test suite coverage percentage
- Number of discovered edge cases
- Reduction in system failures
- Test execution speed and efficiency

## Scope
- Implement property-based testing
- Develop adversarial test scenarios
- Create mutation testing infrastructure
- Expand regression and integration test suites

## Continuous Improvement
- Regular review of testing strategies
- Incorporate feedback from system failures
- Adapt testing approaches to emerging technological challenges
